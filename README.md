# capstone-project-week-4
week 4 of coursera capstone project

My choice of problem is to find out best places to open a restaurant in Toronto.
Good locations for restaurant is one of main condition for success. 
What is the best place? Some place where people go by very often and no restaurant, or less restaurants then in other places.

Using data from Foursquare and data about postal codes of Toronto, i going to find out list of best places to open restaurant.

To find locations i'm going to use set of postal codes of Toronto to split city for regions.
Then using Foursquare data, which contains information about different venues in Toronto, i’m going to find out where restaurants already are.
Then analyze venues categories to group venues into large venue groups as «restaurant», «food», "entertainment»   and so on,
to find regions where less restaurants we are going to Intersect foursquare data with postal codes of Toronto
