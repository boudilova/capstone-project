Introduction/Business Problem

My choice of problem is to find out best places to open a restaurant in Toronto.

Good locations for restaurant is a key to success. 
What is the good location for restaurant? 
Some place with no restaurant or less restaurants then in other places but people go by very often.
Using data from Foursquare and data about postal codes of Toronto, i going to find out list of best places to open restaurant.
